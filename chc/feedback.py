"""How charts play: per-instrument ratings people give RockWizard songs after playing them.

Each rating goes into the song's song.ini, where the app shows it (it is cleared when the song is
re-charted, since it was about the old chart), and is appended to data/feedback.jsonl together
with the models that made the chart (song.ini chc_models), so train.feedback can compare models
by how their charts actually play."""

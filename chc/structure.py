"""Repeated sections: find bars that are the same music and chart them the same way.

Human charters chart a chorus once and copy it. The note models judge every moment on its own,
so each repeat comes out slightly different. Here every bar becomes a fingerprint of how the
instrument sounds on each 16th of the bar; bars with near-identical fingerprints (as part of a
run of matching bars, so one lookalike bar is not enough) are grouped, the notes of a group
vote position by position, and the winning pattern is written into every bar of the group.
Voting across repeats also outvotes stray notes that turn up in only one of them.
